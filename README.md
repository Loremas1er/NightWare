## The owner of crashdami and his friend itskekoff allowed themselves to show off too much, which is why you see the full src of this client (We did not touch the native because there is nothing important in it, all modules are open)
### The full path where all files were stored: "C:\InternalProtect\nightware"
### Their loader is stored here, which can be written in 15 minutes with an open ChatGPT: "C:\InternalProtect\nightware\client\assets\minecraft\indexes"
